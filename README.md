# ABAQUS_script_for_LTB
Breif: A script for building an elastic lateral-torsional buckling process of beams
1. The file named "...continuous.py" is proposed to establish the ABAQUS model of continuous beams.
2. The file named "...simple span beams - N_mm.py" is proposed to establish the ABAQUS model of simple-span beams, such as cantilevers and simple-supported beams.

Note: the obove scripts are only utilized to run in ABAQUS.

Follewing script is helpful to modify the .inp by adding distribution loads conveniently.
"add_distribution_loads_to_inp_file.py"

Follewing script is helpful to output the eigenvalues of the LTB model conveniently.
"output_eigenvalues_from_dat_file.py"
